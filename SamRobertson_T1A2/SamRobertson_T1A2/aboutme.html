        <H2>WHY DID I BEGIN PROGRAMMING?</H2>
        <h3>Straight out of High School I began studying Sport and Exercise Science straight away, thinking that was the career path best suited for me. However I could not have been more wrong. After deferring that due to lack of enjoyment, I have since been on a quest to learn as much as I can and to try new things. I have been very into Gaming and toying with computers my entire life, so that gave me somewhat of an indication of what i wanted to do. After a bit of consideration, with the desire the desire to learn new skills in mind, I decided that doing a Bootcamp with Coder Academy woiuld be perfectly suited for me.</h3>
        <h2>PREVIOUS WORK AND STUDY</h2>
        <h3>Straight out of high school i began studying Sport and Exercise Science however my study there was unfinished. Since then I have just worked a multilide of jobs, ranging from Casual to Full-Time. This includes years of fast food and hospitality work, casual retsil cutomer service experience, and also Full-Time work at a gym. I have since quit the gym as it was unenjoyable and I was feeling myself becoming complacent. That's when I decided to try and better myself by learning new skills, and as a resukt ended up pursuing a full time programming career.<a href="Sams CV copy.pdf">  (See my Resume)</a></h3>
